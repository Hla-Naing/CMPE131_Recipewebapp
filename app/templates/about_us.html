<h1>About This Recipe App</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        This web app is designed with care to help users explore, create, and share food recipes safely and ethically.
        From protecting personal information with encrypted logins to form validation and secure data handling,
        we’re committed to doing things the right way.
    </p>

    <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
    <p>
        We aim to ensure that all users have equal access, whether they’re using a screen reader or browsing from a mobile device.
        We avoid unsupported health claims and rely on trusted sources if nutrition facts are presented.
        Our platform could one day promote local ingredients and seasonal produce, which not only supports small farms
        but also benefits the environment.

    <h2>Engineering Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        We treat this app as a foundation for future work — clarity, transparency, and accountability are key.
        All code is clearly documented, and we follow best practices to make the app safe and extensible.
        Our goal is to create solutions that are not just effective, but also sustainable, inclusive, and ethical.
